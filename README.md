###  Let's Start

1. **What is HTML?**
    - HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.Html is the standard `markup language` used to create web pages.

2. **What is meant by Markup Language**
   - Markup language means a language which defines the `structure of a document using elemnts` like heading,paragraphs,links,lists and more.

3. **What is HTML5?**
   - HTML5 is the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.

4. **What are the new features in HTML5 compared to HTML4?**
   - Some of the new features in HTML5 include new semantic elements, native support for video and audio, new form input types, local storage, canvas for drawing, and improved accessibility.

5. **Give five Advantages of html 5?**
   
   - **Rich Media Support**:
     HTML5 provides native support for audio and video playback without the need for plugins like Flash. This allows developers to create multimedia-rich websites more easily. For example, you can embed a video in HTML5 using the `<video>` element:


   ```html
   <video src="video.mp4" controls></video>
   ```


    -  **Improved Semantics**:
      HTML5 introduces new semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<aside>`, which provide clearer and more meaningful structure to web pages. For example, you can use the `<header>` and `<footer>` elements to define the header and footer sections of a webpage:


   ```html
   <header>
       <h1>My Website</h1>
   </header>
   <footer>
       <p>&copy; 2024 My Website. All rights reserved.</p>
   </footer>
   ```


    - **Offline Application Cache**:
      HTML5 introduces the ability to store web application resources locally, allowing users to use the application even when they are offline. This is achieved using the Application Cache (AppCache) API. For example, you can define a cache manifest file to specify which resources should be cached:

   ```html
   <html manifest="example.appcache">
   ```


   - **Improved Forms**:
      HTML5 introduces new form input types like `email`, `url`, `tel`, `number`, and `date`, as well as new attributes like `required` and `placeholder`, which enhance the user experience and make form validation easier. For example, you can use the `email` input type to create an email input field:


   ```html
   <input type="email" name="email" required>
   ```
   

   - **Canvas and SVG Support**:
     HTML5 introduces the `<canvas>` element for drawing graphics and animations dynamically using JavaScript, and the `<svg>` element for creating scalable vector graphics directly in HTML. For example, you can use the `<canvas>` element to draw a simple rectangle:


   ```html
   <canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
   <script>
       var canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
       var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
       ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 80);
   </script>
   ```
   

6. **What is the purpose of the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration in HTML5?**
   - It specifies to the web browser that the document is an HTML5 document, ensuring that the browser renders the document correctly.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Example Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is an example page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
7. **What is the difference between `HTML` and `XHTML`**

a. ***Syntax Rules***:
   - **HTML**: HTML has more lenient syntax rules, allowing for elements to be unclosed (`<br>`, `<img>`) or have optional closing tags (`</p>` is optional in HTML).
   - **XHTML**: XHTML follows stricter syntax rules derived from XML, requiring all elements to be properly closed and nested. All tags must be lowercase, and attribute values must be enclosed in quotes.

   **Example**:
   ```html
   <!-- HTML -->
   <img src="image.jpg">

   <!-- XHTML -->
   <img src="image.jpg" />
   ```

b. ***Attribute Minimization***:
   - **HTML**: In HTML, some attributes can be minimized, meaning they don't require a value (e.g., `checked`, `disabled`).
   - **XHTML**: All attributes must have a value in XHTML. Attributes like `checked` and `disabled` must be written as `checked="checked"` and `disabled="disabled"`.

   **Example**:
   ```html
   <!-- HTML -->
   <input type="checkbox" checked>
   <button disabled>Click me</button>

   <!-- XHTML -->
   <input type="checkbox" checked="checked" />
   <button disabled="disabled">Click me</button>
   ```

c. ***Document Structure***:
   - **HTML**: In HTML, the document structure is more forgiving, allowing elements like `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` to be omitted in some cases.
   - **XHTML**: XHTML requires a well-defined document structure with the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements always present and properly nested.

   **Example**:
   ```html
   <!-- HTML -->
   <h1>Hello, World!</h1>

   <!-- XHTML -->
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <head>
       <title>Example</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

8. **Difference between `head` and `body` in html**
   - The `<head>` and `<body>` elements are two fundamental parts of an HTML document that serve different purposes:

 ***`<head>` Element***:
   - The `<head>` element contains meta-information about the document, such as the title of the document, links to stylesheets, scripts, and other metadata that is not directly displayed on the page.
   - Content inside the `<head>` element is not visible to the user but is used by browsers and search engines to understand and render the document correctly.

   **Example**:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>Page Title</title>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   </head>
   <body>
       <!-- Content goes here -->
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

 ***`<body>` Element***:
   - The `<body>` element contains the content of the document that is displayed to the user, such as text, images, links, and other elements that make up the visible part of the webpage.
   - All visible content, including headings, paragraphs, images, lists, tables, forms, etc., should be placed inside the `<body>` element.

   **Example**:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>Page Title</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
       <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
       <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image">
       <a href="https://example.com">Link to Example</a>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
9. **What are semantic elements in HTML5?**
   - Semantic elements are tags that provide meaning to the content they enclose, making it easier for search engines and developers to understand the structure of a web page.
Semantic elements in HTML5 are tags that provide meaning to the content they enclose, making it easier for both developers and browsers to understand the structure of a web page. These elements describe the purpose of the content rather than its appearance. Some common semantic elements in HTML5 include:

 ***`<header>`***: Defines a header section for the document or a section of the document.
   ```html
   <header>
       <h1>Website Title</h1>
   </header>
   ```

 ***`<nav>`***: Defines a set of navigation links.
   ```html
   <nav>
       <ul>
           <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
           <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
           <li><a href="#">Services</a></li>
           <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
       </ul>
   </nav>
   ```

 ***`<main>`***: Defines the main content of the document.
   ```html
   <main>
       <article>
           <h2>Article Title</h2>
           <p>Article content goes here...</p>
       </article>
   </main>
   ```

 ***`<section>`***: Defines a section in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document.
   ```html
   <section>
       <h2>Section Title</h2>
       <p>Section content goes here...</p>
   </section>
   ```

 ***`<article>`***: Defines an independent piece of content that could stand alone, such as a blog post or a news article.
   ```html
   <article>
       <h2>Article Title</h2>
       <p>Article content goes here...</p>
   </article>
   ```

 ***`<aside>`***: Defines content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar).
   ```html
   <aside>
       <h3>Related Links</h3>
       <ul>
           <li><a href="#">Link 1</a></li>
           <li><a href="#">Link 2</a></li>
           <li><a href="#">Link 3</a></li>
       </ul>
   </aside>
   ```

 ***`<footer>`***: Defines a footer for the document or a section of the document.
   ```html
   <footer>
       <p>&copy; 2024 My Website. All rights reserved.</p>
   </footer>
   ```
10. **Difference between `Elements` and `Tags` in HTML5?**
   - HTML Elements vs. Tags

***HTML Elements:***  
HTML elements are the basic building blocks of a web page. They consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Elements define the structure and content of the document.

***HTML Tags:***  
HTML tags mark the beginning and end of an element. They are used to define the structure of the document and are enclosed in angle brackets (`<>`).

**Example:**  
```html
<!-- Element: <p> defines a paragraph -->
<p>Interview Question</p>
```
11. **What are the roles and uses of the `<div>` element in HTML?**
 - Roles and Uses of the `<div>` Element in HTML

**Role:**  
The `<div>` element, short for "division," is a generic container used to group together and section off content on a web page. It does not have any inherent meaning or styling, making it highly versatile for structuring and styling content.

**Uses:**
1. **Structuring Content:** `<div>` is commonly used to group related content together, such as a set of paragraphs, images, or form elements.

2. **Styling with CSS:** `<div>` is often used as a target for styling with CSS. Developers can apply classes or IDs to `<div>` elements to apply specific styles or layout properties.

3. **Scripting and Interaction:** `<div>` can be used as a container for interactive elements, such as buttons or dropdown menus, that are manipulated with JavaScript.

**Example:**
```html
<div id="header">
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph in the header section.</p>
</div>

<div class="main-content">
    <h2>Main Content Section</h2>
    <p>This is the main content of the page.</p>
</div>

<div id="footer">
    <p>&copy; 2024 My Website. All rights reserved.</p>
</div>
```
12. **What is difference between `<div>` and `<span>` element?**
 - Difference Between `<div>` and `<span>` Elements

Both `<div>` and `<span>` are generic container elements in HTML used for grouping and styling content, but they have distinct differences in their behavior and typical use cases:

1. **Usage:**
   - `<div>`: Used for block-level grouping of elements. It typically represents a larger section of content, like a section, article, or a container for styling purposes.
   - `<span>`: Used for inline grouping of elements. It is typically used to apply styles to a specific portion of text or inline elements.

2. **Display Type:**
   - `<div>`: By default, `<div>` elements are block-level elements, meaning they start on a new line and stretch to fill the width of their parent container.
   - `<span>`: `<span>` elements are inline elements, meaning they do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.

3. **Default Styling:**
   - `<div>`: Does not have any default styling, so developers need to apply CSS to define its appearance.
   - `<span>`: Also does not have any default styling, requiring CSS for visual styling.

4. **Semantic Meaning:**
   - `<div>`: Used when there is no other more specific semantic element available to represent the content.
   - `<span>`: Similar to `<div>`, but typically used for smaller, inline content that needs to be styled or manipulated separately.

**Example:**
```html
<div style="background-color: lightblue; padding: 10px;">
    This is a <span style="color: red;">highlighted</span> text inside a div.
</div>
```
13. **What is the role of Heading tags in the Html and how it impact SEO?**
    
***Role of Heading Tags in HTML***

Heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) are used to define headings and subheadings within a webpage. They play a crucial role in structuring content and providing hierarchy to the text, which is important for both users and search engines. Here's how heading tags impact a webpage:

- **Semantic Structure:** Heading tags define the structure of a webpage, indicating the main topics and subtopics. This helps users understand the content organization and improves readability.

- **SEO (Search Engine Optimization):** Search engines use heading tags to understand the context and relevance of the content on a webpage. Proper use of headings can positively impact SEO by improving the page's visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs).

- **Accessibility:** Screen readers and other assistive technologies use heading tags to navigate and understand the content. Using headings correctly improves accessibility for users with disabilities.

- **Styling:** By default, browsers render headings with larger and bolder text, which helps to visually distinguish headings from the rest of the content. However, the appearance can be customized using CSS.

  ***Impact on SEO***

Proper use of heading tags can positively impact SEO in several ways:

- **Keyword Optimization:** Heading tags provide an opportunity to include relevant keywords, which can improve the page's relevance for those keywords in search results.

- **Content Organization:** Search engines use heading tags to understand the structure and topics covered in the content. Clear and hierarchical headings can help search engines index the content more effectively.

- **User Experience:** Well-structured headings improve the user experience by making the content easier to scan and understand. This can lead to higher user engagement and lower bounce rates, which are positive signals for SEO.

- **Featured Snippets:** Heading tags are often used by search engines to generate featured snippets, which can increase the visibility of a webpage in search results.

14. **what is difference between `<section>` and `<article>` element?**
-  The `<section>` element is used to group related content together, while the `<article>` element is used to define a self-contained piece of content that can be independently distributed or reused

```html
<section>
    <h2>Section Title</h2>
    <p>This is a section of content.</p>
    <article>
        <h3>Article Title</h3>
        <p>This is a self-contained article within the section.</p>
    </article>
</section>
```
15.**What are Empty elements ?**
  - Empty elements, also known as void or self-closing elements, are elements in HTML that do not have any content between an opening and closing tag. They are self-contained and usually represent a single piece of content or functionality. 

Example: 

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="An image">
<br>
<input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">
```
16.**What are the Block Level and Inline Elements?**
 - `Block-level` elements are those that typically start on a new line and take up the full width available, while `inline elements` are those that do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.

 ***Display:*** Block-level elements have a display property of "block", while inline elements have a display property of "inline".
   
   Example of a block-level element:
   ```html
   <div>This is a block-level element</div>
   ```

   Example of an inline element:
   ```html
   <span>This is an inline element</span>
   ```

 ***Width:*** Block-level elements take up the full width available, while inline elements only take up as much width as necessary.

   Example of a block-level element:
   ```html
   <div style="width: 100px; background-color: lightblue;">Block-level element</div>
   ```

   Example of an inline element:
   ```html
   <span style="background-color: lightblue;">Inline element</span>
   ```

 ***Line Break:*** Block-level elements start on a new line, creating a line break before and after the element, while inline elements do not create a line break.

   Example of a block-level element:
   ```html
   <div>This is a block-level element</div>
   ```

   Example of an inline element:
   ```html
   <span>This is an inline element</span>
   ```
17. **What are the 5 types of links in Html ?**

   ```html
   <map name="map1">
       <area shape="rect" coords="0,0,50,50" href="https://www.example.com">
   </map>
   <img src="image.jpg" usemap="#map1">
   ```

18. **What is difference between Absolute and Relative urls in Html?**
 - Absolute URLs specify the complete web address, including the protocol (e.g., http:// or https://), domain (e.g., www.example.com), and path (e.g., /path/to/page). 

 ```html 
 <a href="https://www.example.com/page">Link</a>`
```

 - Relative URLs specify the path to a resource relative to the current page's URL. 

 ```html
